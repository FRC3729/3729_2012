This repository contains the code used by Regis Jesuit High School's FIRST Robotics Competition team #3729.
Code is released under the GNU General Purpose Licence v3.

We absolutely encourage other FRC teams to take a look at our code and use it however they want, provided they credit us (team 3729) as the source.  However, we also ask that users outside of team 3729 not edit current source, as we pull from this repository frequently and like to know exactly what's going on in the code firsthand.  If you really want to help with something, or see something blatantly wrong in our code, fork this repository and shoot the developers (preferably both) an e-mail about what you changed so we can pull from your fork.

This project was originally hosted on www.bitbucket.com, but was transferred to Sourceforge for greater accessibility.

The root directory is laid out as follows:

./workspaceXX - 20XX repository of code
./workspace - current C++ code repository, so named to be compatible with WindRiver Workbench (based off of Eclipse).  To maintain compatibility with our genMan script, the current year's 'workspaceXX' is just a symlink to 'workspace'.
./docsXX - documentation for the year 20XX, generated using doxygen and pdflatex
./Adam 2010 Source - example code provided to us by Adam Bryant, one of our mentors.  This code was used by Rambotics, team (?) 1583 (I think) during the 2010 season
./Doxyfile - doxygen configuration file
./genMan - Bash script that generates documentation using doxygen and pdflatex
./proto - Contains summer work and prototyping, screw-around files.  For example...
./proto/jaguar_moderation_function.py - Drew Lazzerri's initial draft of our drive ramping function (in Python)
